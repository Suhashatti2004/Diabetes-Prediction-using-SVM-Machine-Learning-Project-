# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM-Machine-Learning-Project-
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Linear Kernel to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical attributes from the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. The model is trained using scikit-learn and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple predictive system for custom inputs
